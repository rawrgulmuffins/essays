I've wanted to write since I was a teenager. Looking into the WayBack machine I read so
many books I received an in school suspension for reading while my Japanese
Language teacher was lecturing. My original pursuit in school was an English
degree so that I could become a writer. I don't remember if I ever actually
visualized what being a writer was like but I knew what crafting stories that
people believed felt like. I'm ashamed to admit that I used to concoct very
elaborate lies for friends and family. My thought process was that works
of fiction were deliberate lies that people loved being told. Therefor, the
better I was at lying the better I was at story telling.

Writing a novel was telling a lie so great and powerful millions of people
chose to believe it.

There are many reasons why I changed degrees but there's three big reasons.

* Shock surprise; being a good lier doesn't make you a good writer.
* There's very little stability with writing. The out comes are close to binary;
you either succeed completely or struggle indefinitely.
* My personal experience was that English degree's weren't focused on making me
a better writer. Now that I have a degree I can see that being better read and
being forced to observe 4 years of fiction would make me better at the thing
that matters (narrative structure). The problem was that my thick skull was
overly focused on the mechanics of improving my writing.
* Which leads to the most important part. I was (and am) a bad writer.

I can write technical documents well. I think it's safe to say at this point. If
that's not a true statement I'm in real trouble. I've written well over a
thousand code base documentations, usage documents, public service
announcements, request for commentaries, and (man) presentations. If I don't
have this one skill by sheer volume then I'm in some horror movie running
through a dark forest trouble.

This is one long windy convoluted way of saying that I aspire to improve my
career prospects through technical writing and improve my sense of self worth
through fiction. I would love to publish a stupid tropey high fantasy space
opera that no one reads.

# That's Nice. Where Is This Going?

I recently asked [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt) a
question on twitter about how she motivates herself to write about things that
matter [to her posts](https://twitter.com/ALordThorsen/status/942854549420752897).


TODO: Take Screen shot and insert here.

The TLDR that took away:
I should lay down explicit goals and what I want those goals to do for me. I
then need to examine if I find those goals motivating.

# Goals Attempt One
TODO: Add what each thing gets me and how much I care.

* I want to write a technical essay every month.

* I want to rewrite this website from scratch and I want to write about it.
The goal would be to make a markdown parser (in rust) that allows for language
extensions. Then I would start extending the language until I get a single
format that can import other formats or media (like asciinima, gifs, pictures,
LaTex, source code, csv's) until I have a language that fits my pretty exacting
set of specifications for technical writing.

* I want to make a Markdown[extended] translation program that produces static
site html / css files which also fit a very exacting set of specifications. The
goal would also be to write about this in order to hone my skills.

* I want to become skilled enough at presenting software techniques, methods,
and concepts that my applications to Software conferences are accepted.

* I want my prose and editing skills to improve to the point where I would
consider actually writing fiction.

* Whenever I run into a work problem that doesn't have a stackoverflow post
associated with it I want to make that first post.

* If I have a hard time debugging an issue I will write down the steps as I
work on each thing and then write about it.

* I want to write about learning skills that aren't a current specialty of mine.

* I will follow the
[three rules](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/01/04/rules-of-programming-experiments/)
for programming experiments [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) created.

# What Are Not My Goals?
* I don't want to become a full time technical writer [a la eevee](https://www.patreon.com/eevee)
* To write a book (at this point in time).
* To become an editor.
* To become a writer for other peoples projects (such as a screen writer).
* To be a great writer. I would have to give up too many things.
* To copy a specific persons style or voice.
* To be noticed in a large public sense. Honestly that's kind of terrifying.
* I don't really care if my writing is useful to anyone other than myself.
Writing to be useful to other people killed this blog in the first place.

# That's Nice. Where Is This Going?

I recently asked [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt) a
question on twitter about how she motivates herself to write about things that
matter [to her posts](https://twitter.com/ALordThorsen/status/942854549420752897).

The TLDR that took away:
I should lay down explicit goals and what I want those goals to do for me. I
then need to examine if I find those goals motivating.

# Goals Attempt One
TODO: Add what each thing gets me and how much I care.

* I want to write a technical essay every month.

* I want to rewrite this website from scratch and I want to write about it.
The goal would be to make a markdown parser (in rust) that allows for language
extensions. Then I would start extending the language until I get a single
format that can import other formats or media (like asciinima, gifs, pictures,
LaTex, source code, csv's) until I have a language that fits my pretty exacting
set of specifications for technical writing.

* I want to make a Markdown[extended] translation program that produces static
site html / css files which also fit a very exacting set of specifications. The
goal would also be to write about this in order to hone my skills.

* I want to become skilled enough at presenting software techniques, methods,
and concepts that my applications to Software conferences are accepted.

* I want my prose and editing skills to improve to the point where I would
consider actually writing fiction.

* Whenever I run into a work problem that doesn't have a stackoverflow post
associated with it I want to make that first post.

* If I have a hard time debugging an issue I will write down the steps as I
work on each thing and then write about it.

* I want to write about learning skills that aren't a current specialty of mine.

* I will follow the
[three rules](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/01/04/rules-of-programming-experiments/)
for programming experiments [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) created.

# What Are Not My Goals?
* I don't want to become a full time technical writer [a la eevee](https://www.patreon.com/eevee)
* To write a book (at this point in time).
* To become an editor.
* To become a writer for other peoples projects (such as a screen writer).
* To be a great writer. I would have to give up too many things.
* To copy a specific persons style or voice.
* To be noticed in a large public sense. Honestly that's kind of terrifying.
* I don't really care if my writing is useful to anyone other than myself.
Writing to be useful to other people killed this blog in the first place.

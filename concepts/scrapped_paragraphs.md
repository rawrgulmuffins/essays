I've wanted to write since I was a teenager. Looking into the WayBack machine I read so
many books I received an in school suspension for reading while my Japanese
Language teacher was lecturing. My original pursuit in school was an English
degree so that I could become a writer. I don't remember if I ever actually
visualized what being a writer was like but I knew what crafting stories that
people believed felt like. I'm ashamed to admit that I used to concoct very
elaborate lies for friends and family. My thought process was that works
of fiction were deliberate lies that people loved being told. Therefor, the
better I was at lying the better I was at story telling.

Writing a novel was telling a lie so great and powerful millions of people
chose to believe it.

There are many reasons why I changed degrees but there's three big reasons.

* Shock surprise; being a good lier doesn't make you a good writer.
* There's very little stability with writing. The out comes are close to binary;
you either succeed completely or struggle indefinitely.
* My personal experience was that English degree's weren't focused on making me
a better writer. Now that I have a degree I can see that being better read and
being forced to observe 4 years of fiction would make me better at the thing
that matters (narrative structure). The problem was that my thick skull was
overly focused on the mechanics of improving my writing.
* Which leads to the most important part. I was (and am) a bad writer.

I can write technical documents well. I think it's safe to say at this point. If
that's not a true statement I'm in real trouble. I've written well over a
thousand code base documentations, usage documents, public service
announcements, request for commentaries, and (man) presentations. If I don't
have this one skill by sheer volume then I'm in some horror movie running
through a dark forest trouble.

This is one long windy convoluted way of saying that I aspire to improve my
career prospects through technical writing and improve my sense of self worth
through fiction. I would love to publish a stupid tropey high fantasy space
opera that no one reads.

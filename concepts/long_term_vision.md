I recently asked [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt) a
question on twitter about how she motivates herself to write about things that
matter [to her posts](https://twitter.com/ALordThorsen/status/942854549420752897).

I have a lot of respect for Stephanie. In my mind she's the successful
counter weight to hold up against people like [Reid Hoffman](https://mastersofscale.com/) who
advocate for going the venture capital founder route in life. Stephanie is a
software engineer / Founder who has build a successful life style business.
Given that I sometimes view being a Venture Capital backed Founder as strip
mining your life looking for precious metals her success is not something to be
scoffed at in my mind.

Another path I've been considering is trying very hard to go the route that
[Brett Cannon](https://twitter.com/brettsky) has taken. In my mind he's an open
source maintainer to a hugely successful project who uses that status to acquire
hard to get positions at companies that want to influence said open source
project.

That sounds kind of bad without my personal context but to me Open Source
projects have (for the most part) been able to view the world and their domain
using a long term vision that I have yet to see in the public or private sector.
It is not uncommon to hear the Python core maintainers to talk about how a Pull
Request will change the 15 year outlook for the project.

In my opinion, giving yourself a high enough perch to see that far in the future

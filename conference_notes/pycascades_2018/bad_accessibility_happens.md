# What are the things you should look at
* Try turning the font size up to 20 for every word and see if it works

* Color of contrast checker ("color of contrast analyzer")
* Apparently a contrast ratio of 1.72 is really bad
* "Just say it's too difficult to put it on top of the picture.
* Alt text is a method to communicate to people who are using a text reader
* "Link, image, advertisement" as an example of a site that isn't accessible
* Aria is another interaction with assistive technology thorough your html.
Apparently it's really overused.

* "A sighted user who uses a mouse."
* Focus state outlines are how people who can't jiggle a mouse finds out where
their focus is at any point in time.

* Create an event listener whose one job is for when you press escape it closes
